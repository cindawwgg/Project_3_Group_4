Project Title: Stock analysis


Team Members: Marry Shintaku, Kirsten Formento, David Jian, Cindy Duong


Project Description/ Outline:
We are a group of data analysts seeking to understand stock price data by performing a fixed-window, technical analysis on a group of stocks. 

Data Sources:
https://www.alphavantage.co/

Legal and Ethical Considerations:
We checked for copyright protections by considering whether our dataset includes information that could be considered original rather than fact. Stock data is considered fact and not opintion. The data is consistent accross all market platforms. We also considered whether the data is structured in a creative or different way. Stock data is presented similarly accross all platforms. We pulled our data from alphavantage for this project and our use of the data is not considered for commercial purposes. We carefully read the terms of use as well as the privacy policy and noted that we are within our rights to using the data.

Fixed-Window & Technical Analysis:
We acknowledge that each company for each stock may be from different industries and/or run their operations uniquely. While we cannot compare each company by how they are operated, we can perform a technical analysis of the historical data and draw conclusions based on the stock data.

Please note that our API data was pulled as of January 30, 2025. The time frame of our analysis will be between the last quarter of 2024 and the first month of 2025. We understand that our analysis of the data will be restricted to this time frame (fixed-window analysis) and that the stock performance may have changed between the time we pulled the data to when we present the information. 

Analysis Summary:
On January 30, 2025, we pulled a list of the stock market's top 20 gainers and the bottom 20 losers for that day. Each group member selected 1 gainer stock and 1 loser stock from that list and performed a technical comparison of their chosen stock.
Gainer List: NVDA, YIBO, DWTX, AKRO
Loser List: WOK, AVGX, ELAB, NRO


Final Folder:
Please see "Final Folder" for our project. The folder contains the website code, the slide deck presentation, our stock data, as well as our visualizations. The jupyter note books contain our code for our analysis as well as our discussion of results (written in markdowns). 


Website Breakdown: Our website was coded in HTML with Bootstrap as the base of the framework. We have created a total of three main pages that consists of a home page, a Big Question page, and a visualizationg page. Our home page shows an introduction to our project. The Big question page presents the questions we are answering. And the visualization page consists of graphs/charts that we created. Each page follows a consistency layout and colors. At the top of each page, we included a navbar allowing quick access between the page. For our visualization, we included a drop down menu that allows you to click between which graphs you want to look at for each of out stocks.
